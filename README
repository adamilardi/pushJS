I created pushJS to send javascript updates to users of any website. 

Goals:
This project should make it very easy to send Javascript to connected user's browsers. It should be one way communication.
In the future I would like to get a live feed of who is logged on and what they are doing.

#requires
node.js     http://nodejs.org/
redis       http://redis.io
socket.io   http://socket.io/
node_redis  https://github.com/mranney/node_redis


Potential uses:
	News websites:
		A breaking news alert
	Shopping sites:
		Push newly added deals


Demo:

The usernames are randomly generated but can easily be replaced with a username from your website.

http://hostname:8081/demo.html   # log into the website and wait for updates
http://hostname:8081/whoison     # admin console to send messages to users
